# DNB-company-Industry-scraper
Python, Selenium, and webdriver webscraper to take input of companies and known traits and output list of respective companies
from Dun and Bradstreet website: www.dnb.com 


Note:
  Python file does NOT sort output list into a neat form. I used PGAdmin4 running custom SQL scripts to get neat results.
